                This policy applies to <strong>statox.ai</strong>, the Statox web app, our mobile apps, and any
                related services. For business customers (agencies, brands, creators), Statox is the
                <strong> data processor</strong> for content and audience data they upload — they remain the data
                controller for that data.

              <h3>b. Connected-account data</h3>
              <p>When you connect Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Google Business, LinkedIn, or WhatsApp, we receive OAuth tokens, your platform username and ID, and access to the data scopes you authorise. Tokens are encrypted (AES-256 / Fernet) at rest.</p>
              <h3>c. Content data</h3>
              <p>Posts, captions, media files, comments, DMs, scheduled drafts, analytics pulled from connected platforms, and customer-uploaded audience lists.</p>
              <h3>d. Usage data</h3>

                Statox uses Anthropic's Claude API to power the AI Assistant, Composer drafts, brand-voice training,

              <ul>
                <li>Your prompts and the relevant context are sent to Anthropic for inference.</li>
                <li>Anthropic does <strong>not</strong> train models on your content (per their Enterprise terms).</li>
                <li>Generated drafts stay in your workspace — we don't reuse them across customers.</li>
                <li>Brand-voice training samples stay in your tenant. They are never blended with another customer's data.</li>
