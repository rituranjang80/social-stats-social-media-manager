 * blogPosts.js — content for /blog and /blog/:slug.
 *
 * Each entry is a JS object (not MDX/Markdown) so we don't pull in a parser
 * for six articles. Bodies are JSX fragments — section objects are turned
 * into headed sections + paragraphs by BlogPostPage. Each post has:
 *
 *   slug, title, excerpt, category, tags, author{name, role, initial},
 *   date, readTime, accent, body[]  — ordered list of nodes:
 *     { type: 'lead' | 'p' | 'h2' | 'h3' | 'ul' | 'ol' | 'quote' | 'callout',
 *       text|items|children }
 *
 * BlogIndexPage uses everything but `body`. BlogPostPage renders `body`
 * sequentially and builds a TOC from `h2` nodes.
