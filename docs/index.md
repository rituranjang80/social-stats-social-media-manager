## What it does

- **Social media scheduler & content calendar** — one composer with per-platform
  formatting, brand-voice AI captions, scheduling, agency approval flows,
  Connect Channels, first comment, internal tags, and a Multi-workspace & Teams
  (Organization → Workspace → Members) layout.
- **Social media analytics dashboard** — daily-metric ingestion across Facebook,
  Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Google Business, with a time-series API and
  per-client dashboards.
- **Unified inbox** — DMs, comments, and Google reviews in one queue, with AI
  reply suggestions in your brand voice.
- **Click-to-WhatsApp bot builder** — a visual flow editor with conditional
  branches and AI chat nodes.
- **Agency marketplace** — a two-sided directory connecting businesses with
  agencies.
- **AI social media assistant** — powered by Anthropic Claude.
- **Multi-tenant access** — agency / end-user model, per-client workspaces,
  staff RBAC, invitations, and client collaborator role.
